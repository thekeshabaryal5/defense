stack vs heap ?

stack stores the static data (fixed size data) in its own while for dynamic data it stores its address and that dynamic data is actually stored in heap memory.

so when we want a data we go for stack if its static we get the data from there only, while if its dynamic we get the address to heap memory.

32 bit OS vs 64 bit OS:
in 32bit machine the maximum addresses supported is: 2^32, but the memory is byte addressable.
i.e 32bit can support 2^32 bytes of memory nearly equal to 4GB of memory.
