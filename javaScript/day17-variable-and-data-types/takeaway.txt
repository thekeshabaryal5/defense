how to make a variable ?
let name = "keshab"

var has a function scope and a global scoped (if declared at a global scope) and shows unusual behaviour so we don't use var instead we use let and const.


data types:
primitive data types:
    number,string,boolean,undefined, null, bigint, symbol

Non primitive
    array, object, function


bigint
let num = 1234343534n;


typeof operator to know the type of variable.

primitive vs non-primitive data type.
