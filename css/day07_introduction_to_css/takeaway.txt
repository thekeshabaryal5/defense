css ----> cascading sytle sheet

Inline css
this is the css giving type where css is given to the element itself
e.g:
 <h1 style="background-color: aqua">Gym Website</h1>


Internal CSS
This type of css is written inside the <style></style> tag of <head></head> section
e.g:
    <style>
      h1 {
        background-color: blue;
        color: white;
      }
      h2 {
        background-color: antiquewhite;
      }
    </style>


External CSS
In this type of styling we make an external css file for e.g. sytle.css and define the style for element in this file.

for e.g:
h1 {
  background-color: pink;
}
h2 {
  background-color: aquamarine;
}

link the style.css file in the html file using:
<link rel="stylesheet" href="style.css">
in the head section



usability:
inline and internal are rarely used more rarely inline
in general practice we use external css only

benefits of using external css ???
    same css file can be used for multiple html file too.
    



CSS selector
  1.Element selector / tag selector :
    selecting an element based on the tag
  like: h1, h2, ol, li, ......

  h1{
    background-color:grey;
  }

  2. Id selector
    id is given to the element and style is given on the basis of that id
          <h2 id="first">Exercise</h2>
          #first{
            background-color:grey
          }

3. Class Selector:
          class is used for grouping.
          multiple element can share a same class
          a element can have both class and id but id style overrides the class style

4. group based selection:
          group based selection refers to giving same css to multiple classes, elements or id
          for e.g:
          <h1>Name</h1>
          <h2 id="mname">Mid Name</h2>
          <h3 class="lname">Last Name</h3>

          css:
          h1, #mname, .lname{
            background-color:violet
          }

          here all the h1 element element with id mname and element with class lname will be styled to background-color as violet

Font
what is font ?

pixel: ----> picture element
  1 pixel is equal to 1/96 of an inch  THIS IS WRONG 
  pixel is the smallest unit of any image and its size depends upon the screen NOT 1/96 of inch

font size:
em
em refers to multiple of parents size:
if 1 em then size is equal to size of parent
for 2 em size equal to two times of parent's size  

rem:
refers to root element which is html tag  

vw
h1{
  font-size: 2vw
}
this means the font size of h1 element is equal to 2% of view-port width

vh
h1{
  font-size: 2vh
}
this means the font size of h1 element is equal to 2% of view-port height

percentage unit (%)
h1{
  font-size: 20%
}

means the font size of h1 element is 20% of its direct parent.
