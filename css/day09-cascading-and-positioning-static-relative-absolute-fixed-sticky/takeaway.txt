Cascade and Positioning
    Inline CSS have the most preference (Highest priority)

    For internal and external css whichever is listed at the bottom that gets priority over another.

So the order: 
    Inline always at top
    Internal and external depends whichever is at the top position.

Priority of css:
    First priority is given to id selector,
    second priority is given to class
    and finally to element

Priority order of css 
    0. !important
    1. Inline css
    2. id selector
    3. class selector
    4. tag selector

!important -----> using this property we can override the priority at any level

                        CSS Positioning

position:
    static ----> default 
    relative
    fixed
    sticky
    absolute


relative:

position the element relative to the original position.
    h2 {
  background-color: orange;
  position: relative;
  left: 20px;   \\ shifts 20px from the left side of original position and shfits to right side
  /* top: 250px; */ shift the element 250px from the top of relative position
  /* bottom: 65px; */ shift the element 65px above from the bottom of the original position
}


fixed:
to fix the element relative to the window.
position:fixed;
top:20px;
left:40px;
right:48px;


for position relative
no other element can occupy the original place of the element even though its displaced using relative and shifting some distances.

for fixed: 
the original place is vaccant and other can occupy that position

sticky:
works similar to fixed but keeps the element fixed when its top is 0px;

h4 {
  background-color: maroon;
  position: sticky;
  top: 50px;
}
this makes h4 fixed when its 50px from the above height;


absolute:
sets its position relative to nearest positioned ancestor.
if no ancestor is positioned then it sets its position relative to the window.

z-index: 10
z-index determines which element will be visible when one element overrides the other.

default z-index for all the element is 0
the element whose z-index is higher that will be visible.
